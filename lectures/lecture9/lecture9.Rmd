# Introduction

# Why and when to write a function

### Example with recruiting data

- perform some task without a function
- perform repeat/variation of this task without a function

- show this task done with a function
- [can show the function but don't need to explain how it works; just show its utility]

# Function basics

## how to write a function

- first example could be hello: then hell with argument name; then hello with argument for calculating age based in input dob;

# Conditional execution

# Functional arguments
