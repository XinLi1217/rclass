# General

## wish list for beamer slides

- when I run a code chunk RMarkdown that includes a print of data, the printout below the chunk looks the way printing data from console looks as opposed to having the df_print: paged style (HTML tables with support for pagination over rows and columns)
- smaller font-size; similar to fontsize from Christenson slides
- code in code chunks wraps to next row rather then bleeds off right margin
- reduce horizontal space between line of text and first item of list below that line of text

## Stuff for students to do before class

1. Install R
1. Install RStudio
1. Install MikTeX
1. Knit following documents in RMarkdown
    - html
    - pdf_document
    - beamer_presentation
1. Watch videos on relative and absolute filepaths
    - the general one
    - the one in R
1. Complete intro to R tutorials
    - which ones

What Patricia says:

2.	You might be planning to do this anyway, but I think it would be a good idea to explain what data management is during the first class meeting. Equally important, we should mention who this class is for. What I mean by this is that there may be folks who are experienced with R, but have no clue how to clean data or other folks who have experience with data management, but are new to R, or others who have no experience with either, etc. 
3.	It would also be a good idea to discuss other uses for R during the first class meeting (graphing, mapping, web scraping, etc.) to introduce students to the various uses of R so they could potentially invest in learning more advanced methods in the future. 
4.	I agree that strings require at least two weeks, but I also think we should briefly go over them if we can because they may be needed for the weeks on functions and iterations. 



### Learning objectives

- directories
    - understand difference between absolute and relative filepaths
    - can identify the current working directory
    - change the working directory using absolute filepath
    - change current working directory using relative filepath
- data types
    - Understand the different data types and how they fit into broader categories
