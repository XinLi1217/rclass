# General

## wish list for beamer slides

- smaller font-size; similar to fontsize from Christenson slides
- code in code chunks wraps to next row rather then bleeds off right margin
- reduce horizontal space between line of text and first item of list below that line of text
- when I run a code chunk RMarkdown that includes a print of data, the printout below the chunk looks the way printing data from console looks as opposed to having the df_print: paged style (HTML tables with support for pagination over rows and columns)

## Stuff for students to do before class

1. Install R
1. Install RStudio
1. Install MikTeX
1. Knit following documents in RMarkdown
    - html
    - pdf_document
    - beamer_presentation
1. Watch videos on relative and absolute filepaths
    - the general one
    - the one in R
1. Complete intro to R tutorials
    - which ones

What Patricia says:

2.	You might be planning to do this anyway, but I think it would be a good idea to explain what data management is during the first class meeting. Equally important, we should mention who this class is for. What I mean by this is that there may be folks who are experienced with R, but have no clue how to clean data or other folks who have experience with data management, but are new to R, or others who have no experience with either, etc. 
3.	It would also be a good idea to discuss other uses for R during the first class meeting (graphing, mapping, web scraping, etc.) to introduce students to the various uses of R so they could potentially invest in learning more advanced methods in the future. 
4.	I agree that strings require at least two weeks, but I also think we should briefly go over them if we can because they may be needed for the weeks on functions and iterations.

### questions [for Ben/Crystal]

* How to introduce data types and data structures
    - Skinner introduces concept of data types (logical, numeric, character) and data structures (vectors, lists, etc.); 
    - by contrast, Wickham introduces vectors [atomic vectors vs. lists] and then the data types as different types of atomic vectors
        - [LINK TO FIGURE](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-structures-overview.png)
    - which is correct?

## Class X. Processing across rows; exploratory data analysis for data quality

### Big topics

  - Processing across rows with summarize() and group by


### Learning objectives

### Order of lecture

1. Processing across obs
    1. introduce group_by() and summarize()
        - Introduce each command on its own and then together
        - ? INTRODUCE SUMMARISE() OR GROUP_BY() FIRST?
        - Common functions to use with summarize (e.g., n _, mean, median, sum, nth)
    1. How missing values handled by summarize
be a missing value. Fortunately, all aggregation functions have an na.rm argument which removes the missing values prior to computation:"
    1. Means, counts, and sum
        - counts: n(), which takes no arguments, and returns the size of the current group. 
            - talk about n() vs. count() function
          - Counts and proportions of logical values: sum(x > 10), mean(y == 0). When used with numeric functions, TRUE is converted to 1 and FALSE to 0. This makes sum() and mean() very useful: sum(x) gives the number of TRUEs in x, and mean(x) gives the proportion.            
    1. Other summary functions [5.6.4]
        - measures of position e.g., first(x) x[1]
            - "Measures of position: first(x), nth(x, 2), last(x). These work similarly to x[1], x[2], and x[length(x)] but let you set a default value if that position does not exist (i.e. you’re trying to get the 3rd element from a group that only has two elements). For example, we can find the first and last departure for each day:"
    1. combining processing across obs with filtering
    1. grouping by multiple variables [I haven't re-read this section of wickham yet]
    1. appears that you can skip 5.7 grouped/mutates and filters
