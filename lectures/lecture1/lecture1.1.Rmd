```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>", highlight = TRUE)
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, highlight = TRUE)
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE)
  #comment = "#>" makes it so results from a code chunk start with "#>"; default is "##"
```
# What is R

### What is R

According to the Inter-university consortium for political and social research [(ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/shared/ICPSR/faqs/what-is-r.html), R is "an alternative to traditional statistical packages such as SPSS, SAS, and Stata such that it is an extensible, open-source language and computing environment for Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, and Linux platforms. Such software allows for the user to freely distribute, study, change, and improve the software under the [Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html)."

### Graphs 
- Create graphs with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Source: http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# load package and data
options(scipen=999)  # turn-off scientific notation like 1e+48
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())  # pre-set the bw theme.
data("midwest", package = "ggplot2")
# midwest <- read.csv("http://goo.gl/G1K41K")  # bkup data source

# Scatterplot
gg <- ggplot(midwest, aes(x=area, y=poptotal)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col=state, size=popdensity)) + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess", se=F) + 
  xlim(c(0, 0.1)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 500000)) + 
  labs(subtitle="Area Vs Population", 
       y="Population", 
       x="Area", 
       title="Scatterplot", 
       caption = "Source: midwest")

plot(gg)
```

### Base R vs. R packages

There are "default" packages that come with [R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html). Some of these include:  

- `as.character`  
- `print`  
- `setwd`

And there are [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html) developed and shared by others. Some R packages include:  

- `tidyverse`  
- `stargazer`  
- `foreign`  

more about these in later weeks...

### Installing and Loading R packages
You only need to install a package once. To install an R package use `install.package()` function.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```

However, you need to load a package everytime you plan to use it. To load a package use the `library()` function. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



### Functions; function syntax

[I MAY MOVE THIS SLIDE BELOW; JUST WANT YOU TO DRAFT IT]

describe basic syntax of functions in R; how to get help on a function

### RStudio

"[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/features/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management."

### R Markdown
[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) produces dynamic output formats in html, pdf, MS Word, dashboards, Beamer presentations, etc.

- We will be using R Markdown for lectures and homeworks.
